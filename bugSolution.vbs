Error Handling and Early Binding:

Improved code using On Error Resume Next for graceful handling of missing objects or methods and early binding where feasible:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next

Dim obj As Object
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Object.That.Might.Not.Exist")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  WScript.Echo "Error creating object: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
Else
  On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
  result = obj.SomeMethod()
  WScript.Echo "Result: " & result
  On Error Resume Next
End If

Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
  WScript.Echo "Error calling method: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
End Sub
```

Note: Early binding is not always possible, but it's highly recommended whenever feasible for improved robustness and performance.
